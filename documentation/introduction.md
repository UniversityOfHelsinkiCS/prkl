## Introduction

Assembler is a group-forming tool used to automatically create compatible groups for courses with group assignments. Often, when students are left in charge of forming groups, the results are unwanted. Friends will quickly form into groups, and people are easily left out. New students have a hard time finding a group, and established friend groups donâ€™t meet new people.

With our app, the course teacher can create a questionnaire for the students. The questionnaire contains relevant questions for the course, eg. skills and experience working with certain technologies and anything else you can/want to fit inside a multiple choice question. Additionally, the question set can contain a timetable, where students fill in suitable times to work on the course project. 

The answers are then fed to an algorithm, which generates matching groups of a given size. The primary target is to generate groups with enough matching times, and to use the questions as a tiebreaker. The course teacher can also manually adjust these groups after the algorithm has created them. When the groups are ready, the students will receive the contact info for their group, as well as all of their compatible times.
