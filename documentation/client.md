**Client**

The client-side of our app should be familiar to anyone who has completed the Full Stack-web development course. 

Localisation to different languages has been built into our app. All displayed text is contained inside client/localisation/messages.js. In order to port it to another language, read up on intl.

It appears that the keepalive polling (used to keep the user logged in) seems to not work in production: returns 404 instead.
