**Unfinished tasks/planned but not started:**

* **The ability for an admin to assign a user as a teacher for a course.**  
E.g. if a course has multiple teachers or assistans, it would be desirable to give “admin” privileges to the assistants.

* **A question ‘bank’ for quickly creating similar groups.**  
If the same or similar course is held as one before, the teacher could select a suitable pre-filled form from the bank to save time on writing the same questions. Also obviously created courses should be able to (either automatically or manually) saved to the bank.

* **The ability to ‘weight’ different questions or answer choices.**  
Some questions are more relevant than others for creating groups. The ability to score the importance of specific questions or answer choices within questions. This would preferably be implemented when creating the groups, so the algorithm could be run multiple times with different parameters to create better groupings.
