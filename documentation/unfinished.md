**Unfinished tasks/planned but not started:**

* **Overview of the teachers' own courses.**  
A “publish button” for a course and groups. When a teacher creates a course or group they are published immediately. It would be desirable, that a teacher can create a course (it being invisible to students) then later publish it so it becomes visible(same for groups).

* **The ability to edit a course.**  
This was discussed many times, but there was an argument that when courses are created they are final. However small edits would be nice, if e.g. typos are made.

* **The ability for an admin to assign a user as a teacher for a course.**  
E.g. if a course has multiple teachers or assistans, it would be desirable to give “admin” privileges to the assistants. For this to be implemented the database structure needs to be updated as now a course can only have one teacher.

* **A question ‘bank’ for quickly creating similar groups.**  
If the same or similar course is held as one before, the teacher could select a suitable pre-filled form from the bank to save time on writing the same questions. Also obviously created courses should be able to (either automatically or manually) saved to the bank.

* **The ability to delete an enrollment.**  
Giving the option to either the teacher or the student. In the current state, if a student enrolls for a course there is no way to delete the enrollment. 

* **The ability to ‘weight’ different questions or answer choices.**  
ifferent questions are more relevant to creating groups. The ability to score the importance of specific questions or answer choices within questions. This would preferably be implemented when creating the groups, so the algorithm could be run multiple times with different parameters to create better groupings.
