**Unfinished tasks/planned but not started:**

All planned/suggested features can be found from [Backlog](https://github.com/UniversityOfHelsinkiCS/prkl/projects/1). For convenience, the most impactful of them are also listed here.

* **A question ‘bank’ for quickly creating similar groups.**  
If the same or similar course is held as one before, the teacher could select a suitable pre-filled form from the bank to save time on writing the same questions. Also obviously created courses should be able to (either automatically or manually) saved to the bank.

* **The ability to ‘weight’ different questions or answer choices.**  
Some questions are more relevant than others for creating groups. The ability to score the importance of specific questions or answer choices within questions. This would preferably be implemented when creating the groups, so the algorithm could be run multiple times with different parameters to create better groupings.

* **The ability to lock specific groups and let algorithm create new groups for remaining students.**
Teacher could confirm some groups to be ready and use algorithm to create solid groups for rest of students.

* **The ability to find best group for specific student.**
There might be some students, who have only few suitable times. Algorithm could find the most suitable groups for those kind of students.

* **Shuffle students in a way that named groups are retained.**
Groups are usually assigned to course assistants so it would make sense to keep named groups untouchable and only shuffle new students who have suitable times into group.

* **Export assembled groups eg. in csv-file.**
Information about groups are often useful outside assembler too.

* **Warning about problems when manually tinkering with groups.**
App should warn teacher if they move student to group which is unsuitable due to eg. differencies in working times.

* **Assistants to courses.**
Courses usually have assistants who needs to attend meetings with students in some groups. Assembler could help with assigning groups to assistants based on assistant's choice of working times.

* **The ability to allow 'friend' groups.**
Sometimes it's ok to let students have group wishes. Algorithm could take them account.

* **The ability to copy courses.**
Many courses have same kind of iterations over time. Copying course would make it faster to create a new iteration.
